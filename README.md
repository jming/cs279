*Going the Distance: Human Computing to Find Accessible Routes in Real-Time*
By Dianna Hu and Joy Ming

In this paper we describe a human computation approach for solving the problem of finding an accessible route between two given locations. 
The system will take as input a user question, ask workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to verify the accessibility of the routes returned by 
Google Maps using Google Street View (GSV), and re-route the user until an accessible route is found. Within each step we present a section, verify, 
select, and fix paradigm to assign tasks to workers in a collaborative manner. We show that our paradigm and specifically designed 
quality control methods allow remote workers to properly verify and create accessible routes.
